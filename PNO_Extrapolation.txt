ABSTRACT
The domain-based local pair natural orbital coupled cluster DLPNO-CCSD(T) method allows one to perform single point energy calculations for systems with hundreds of atoms while retaining essentially the accuracy of its canonical counterpart, with errors that are typically smaller than 1 kcal/mol for relative energies. Crucial to the accuracy and efficiency of the method is a proper definition of the virtual space in which the coupled cluster equations are solved, which is spanned by a highly compact set of pair natural orbitals (PNOs) that are specific for each electron pair. The dimension of the PNO space is controlled by the TCutPNO, threshold: only PNOs with an occupation number greater than TCutPNO are included in the correlation space of a given electron pair, whilst the remaining PNOs are discarded. To keep the error of the method small, a conservative TCutPNO value is used in standard DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations. This often leads to unnecessarily large PNO spaces, which limits the efficiency of the method. Herein, we introduce a new computational strategy to approach the complete PNO space limit (for a given basis set) that consists in extrapolating the results obtained with different TCutPNO values. The method is validated on the GMTKN55 set using canonical CCSD(T) data as reference. Our results demonstrate that a simple two-point extrapolation scheme can be used to significantly increase the efficiency and accuracy of DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, thus extending the range of applicability of the technique.

1. INTRODUCTION
The coupled cluster method with singles, doubles, and perturbatively included triples excitations, i.e., CCSD(T),1 can be used to compute relative energies with errors compared to experimental reference data that often fall within the experimental uncertainty.2 Therefore, it is generally regarded as the “gold standard” of quantum chemistry. Unfortunately, its computational cost scales as the seventh power of the system size, and hence CCSD(T) calculations are only affordable for very small benchmark systems. In order to overcome this limitation, linear scaling local CCSD(T) variants that exploit the rapid decay of electron correlation with the inter-electronic distance have been developed.3–5
In particular, the domain-based local pair natural orbital CCSD(T) method [DLPNO-CCSD(T)]5–13 has allowed for the calculation of single point energies for entire proteins.14 To achieve such an efficiency, the coupled cluster equations are solved in an extremely compact virtual space, which is tailored for each electron pair and spanned by a small set Pair Natural Orbitals (PNOs).6 Only the PNOs with an occupation number greater than a threshold, denoted as TCutPNO, are included in the correlation space of a given electron pair.   
When TightPNO settings5,13 are used (in this case, TCutPNO  is set to 10-7 by default), DLPNO-CCSD(T) typically retains around 99.9% of the canonical CCSD(T) correlation energy. Thus, as shown on many benchmark data sets,13,15–18 it  provides essentially  the same accuracy and reliability of the parent canonical method. On the 1505 reactions of the GMTKN55 superset,19 DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO results showed mean absolute errors (MAEs) compared to canonical CCSD(T) below 0.2 kcal/mol on 39 subsets, between 0.2 and 0.4 kcal/mol on 14 subsets and larger than 0.4 kcal/mol for two subsets (RC21 and MB16-43).18 Even more accurate results could in principle be achieved by including more PNOs in the virtual space, i.e., by tightening the TCutPNO threshold to 10-8 or 10-9. Unfortunately, the computational cost of such calculations often approaches that of canonical CCSD(T). 
Herein, we suggest an alternative computational strategy to reduce the PNO truncation error. In particular, DLPNO-CCSD(T) results obtained with different TCutPNO thresholds are extrapolated to the complete PNO space limit using a two-point extrapolation scheme. Two different approaches are thoroughly tested, namely TCutPNO = 10-5 / TCutPNO = 10-6 (denoted hereafter as 5/6 extrapolation) and TCutPNO =   10-6 / TCutPNO = 10-7 (denoted hereafter as 6/7 extrapolation). Our results demonstrate that 5/6 extrapolation approaches TightPNO accuracy at a fraction of its computational cost. Moreover, 6/7 extrapolation significantly improves the accuracy of TightPNO calculations, roughly halving the MAE with respect to canonical CCSD(T) for all the tested benchmark sets. 
The paper is organized as follows. The PNO extrapolation scheme is described in Section 2. The accuracy of the method is tested on the GMTKN55 superset in Section 3.1. The basis set dependence of the extrapolated results and the efficiency of the extrapolation scheme are assessed in Section 3.2. The accuracy and efficiency of the proposed approach is further discussed in Section 3.3 on a particularly challenging application for standard computational methods, i.e., the quantification of dispersion-dominated interactions. Section 4 is devoted to the concluding remarks of this study.
2. BENCHMARK SETS, THEORETICAL ASPECTS, AND COMPUTATIONAL DETAILS
2.1. Benchmark Sets. The PNO extrapolation scheme is tested on the GMTKN55 subsets for which DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO results showed a MAE of 0.2 kcal/mol or more with respect to canonical CCSD(T),  i.e., on 16 subsets.18 The subsets can be grouped in five different families:
W4-11, YBDE18, RC21, and DC13:  reaction energies for small systems; 
MBE16-43, DARC, RSE43, BSR36, and ISOL24:  reaction energies for large systems, it includes isomerization processes; 
BHPERI: reaction barrier heights;
IDISP:  intramolecular interactions; 
ADIM6, S22, S66, WATER27, and IL6: intermolecular noncovalent interactions. 
Overall, the present study involves 883 molecules and 499 reactions.
2.2. PNO Extrapolation.  To investigate the dependence of the DLPNO-CCSD(T) correlation energy on the dimension of the PNO space we initially considered the benzene dimer, in which the two monomers are arranged in a parallel shifted configuration (the geometry was taken from reaction 24 of the S66 set). For this system, the dependence of the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK correlation energy on the TCutPNO threshold 10-X (X = 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9) is shown in Figure 1. 
Figure 1. Dependence of DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK correlation energy EX on the exponent X of TCutPNO = 10-X for benzene dimer. E corresponds to the correlation energy at the complete PNO space limit.
Consistent with earlier PNO studies,20,21 the correlation energy converges smoothly by tightening the TCutPNO threshold. The best fit is obtained with the following functional form:
where E^X is the correlation energy obtained with TCutPNO = 10-X and E^ is the target energy (for a given basis set) at the complete PNO space limit; A and ß are constants (A = 84.92; ß = 5.55). The smooth convergence of the correlation energy suggests that a simple two-point extrapolation procedure could be used to extrapolate the results obtained for small X values to the complete PNO space limit.  
By defining Y = X + 1, and EX and EY as the correlation energies obtained with the corresponding TCutPNO = 10-X and TCutPNO = 10-Y values, one obtains the following expression for the correlation energy at the complete PNO space limit: 
Eq. 4 is the basis of the PNO extrapolation scheme proposed in this work. Hence, all that it is required to perform the extrapolation is the calculation of E^X and E^Y, together with the knowledge of the single parameter F. Importantly, E^X and E^Y must be obtained from DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations that use exactly the same computational settings (e.g., the same basis set and DLPNO settings) with the only exception being the TCutPNO threshold. 
For the benchmark sets investigated in this work, the optimal F value, i.e, the one that minimizes the error with respect to canonical CCSD(T), deviates within the 1.5 ± 0.2 range. It is important to note that the dependency of the MAE on the F value is very small within this range. Hence, for the sake of simplicity, the recommended F value is 1.5 for both 5/6 and 6/7 extrapolations.
Note that eq. 4 does not make any strong assumption on the functional form that better describes the convergence of the correlation energy with respect to the TCutPNO threshold. For example, an exponential functional form of the type
would provide the following expression for the two-point extrapolated energy:  
It is worth mentioning here that eq. 4 (as well as eq. 2 and eq. 6) is analogous to that commonly used in two-point extrapolation schemes to the complete basis set (CBS) limit.22–25 In these schemes, E is the CBS extrapolated energy, and EX and EY are the energies obtained with two basis sets of consecutive X and Y cardinality. In the extrapolation of HF energies,22 it is usually assumed that E^X-E is proportional to e^(-a(?X)?^? ), where ? is typically 1 or 0.5, and a is a constant obtained from fits to accurate benchmark energies. Correlation energies are usually extrapolated by considering that E^X-E is proportional to X-ß (with ß ? 3).23  Importantly, when the ß value (or equivalently F) is obtained from an RMS fit to benchmark data, the extrapolated energies were shown to improve notably.24,25
2.3. Efficiency Considerations. In the present work, EX and EY were obtained from separate DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO calculations using TCutPNO = 10-X and TCutPNO = 10-Y, respectively (Y = X+1). As TCutPNO = 10-X settings are significantly more efficient than TCutPNO = 10-Y settings, the overall X/Y extrapolation procedure is only slightly more expensive than the corresponding TCutPNO = 10-Y calculation. For example, the computational cost of TCutPNO = 10-6 calculations is typically 30-40% of that of TCutPNO = 10-7 calculations, as shown in Sections 3.2 and 3.3. As it will be demonstrated numerically below for a large data set, X/Y extrapolation calculations are typically 2 times faster than the corresponding TCutPNO = 10-(Y+1) calculations. This indicates that the PNO extrapolation scheme provides a cost-effective alternative to tightening the TCutPNO threshold.
It is worth mentioning here that a different computational strategy was also tested as an attempt to further increase the efficiency of the extrapolation approach proposed here. As the TCutPNO = 10-X virtual space is a subset of the TCutPNO = 10-Y virtual space if X < Y, an approximate estimate for the TCutPNO = 10-X energy can be obtained from the TCutPNO = 10-Y amplitudes. This could potentially save computer time by avoiding redundant operations.  From a technical point of view, this was achieved by exploiting the fact that the correlation energy can always be written as a sum of “pair correlation energies” e_ij, i.e., contributions from pairs of localized occupied orbitals ij. Within the PNO approximation, the strong-pairs11 component of e_ij reads:
For each ij pair, upon entering the PNO generation for the 10-Y calculation, the PNOs for a threshold of 10-X were also automatically generated. This provides us with two sets of perturbative weak-pair and PNO incompleteness corrections, namely ?Ewp (10-Y) and ?Ewp (10-X). The overlap matrix between the PNOs in the TCutPNO = 10-Yy and TCutPNO = 10-X spaces S_ ^(ij ) was also computed and stored. 
Then, the solution of the DLPNO-CCSD equations for TCutPNO = 10-Y provided us with the corresponding  t_(a_ij b_ij)^ij (10-Y) amplitudes and hence with pair correlation energies (eq. 8). The overall DLPNO-CCSD correlation energy associated with TCutPNO = 10-Y was computed by adding ?Ewp (10-Y) to the correlation energy from the strong pairs. In the next step,  S_ ^(ij ) was used to project the t_(a_ij b_ij)^ij (10-Y) amplitudes from the TCutPNO = 10-Y to the TCutPNO = 10-X space:
This projection is necessary since the PNOs for a given pair are recanonicalized before entering the cluster amplitude iterations. The projected amplitudes were transformed back to the original TCutPNO = 10-Y space and used to estimate the strong pair component of the correlation energy associated with TCutPNO = 10-X.  ?Ewp (10-X) was added to this energy to compute the overall DLPNO-CCSD correlation energy in the TCutPNO = 10-X space. Note that in this approach we generate exactly the same PNOs as in a separate 10-X calculation. However, the resulting amplitudes are not identical to the ‘genuine’ 10-X amplitudes, since the relaxation of the amplitudes after the projection is neglected.  The triples correction contribution can be computed as usual14 starting from converged doubles amplitudes for TCutPNO = 10-Y  and from projected doubles amplitudes for TCutPNO = 10-X. 
This procedure was implemented in ORCA and tested on the S22 and WATER27 sets. Although this scheme allows us to skip the DLPNO-CCSD part for TCutPNO = 10-X calculations, which accounts for ~25% of the overall computational time, it also introduces a non-negligible error in the TCutPNO = 10-X amplitudes that deteriorates the quality of the extrapolated results (see AutoExtr-S22 and AutoExtr-WATER27 sheets of Supporting Information). Given the need to reconverge of the amplitudes and the fact that the triples amplitudes must be iterated too with the reconverged doubles amplitudes, the computational savings that can be realized over two separate calculations are very modest. This is particularly true, since the tighter threshold calculation needs to be performed in either scheme and dominates the overall computation time. Hence, for all intent and purposes, the extrapolation procedure discussed in Section 2.2 is recommended. Its accuracy and efficiency are discussed in the following sections.
2.4. Computational Details. All calculations were performed with a development version of the ORCA program package based on version 4.2.26–28 CCSD(T) and DLPNO-CCSD(T) correlation energies were calculated with the default frozen core settings in ORCA.29 For open-shell molecules, the reference energy was obtained at the quasi-restricted orbital (QRO) level.30 The perturbative triples contributions were calculated using the recently published iterative (T1) algorithm for both closed-shell31 and open-shell32 systems. Since we use here the improved (T1) algorithm for open-shell system,32 the present open-shell DLPNO-CCSD(T) results are not exactly the same as the previously reported ones.18 The variations are, however, very small. Integral evaluations in DLPNO-based correlation energy calculations need an auxiliary basis set. This was generated using the automated auxiliary basis set construction module of ORCA (the so-called “autoaux”) with the maximum possible angular momentum.33 Canonical CCSD(T) calculations were performed without any resolution of identity (RI) approximation.
Unless stated otherwise, both canonical and DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations were performed with the relativistic second-order Douglas-Kroll-Hess Hamiltonian (DKH2)34,35 in conjunction with the appropriate aug-cc-pVDZ-DK basis set,36–38 consistent with the previous benchmark study on the GMTKN55 superset.18 Although correlation energies obtained with double-? quality basis sets might suffer from severe basis set incompleteness error, the comparison of DLPNO-CCSD(T) and CCSD(T) results obtained with the same basis set  makes it possible to assess the error inherent to the DLPNO approximation.18 
For the W4-11,39 YBDE18,40 and S6641  sets, DLPNO-CCSD(T) and CCSD(T) results were also compared for larger basis sets, as discussed in Section 3.2. For the W4-11 set, the aug-cc-pVTZ-DK and aug-cc-pVQZ-DK basis sets36–38 were used with the same settings described above. For the YBDE18 and S66 sets, canonical CCSD(T) calculations are not possible with quadruple-? quality basis sets. Therefore, the previously published40,42 explicitly correlated CCSD(T) energies were used as reference data in these cases. DLPNO-CCSD(T) interaction energies were computed using aug-cc-pVTZ and aug-cc-pVQZ basis sets. In the correlation part, the auxiliary basis sets constructed with the autoaux module (see above) were used for the YBDE18 set, while the matching aug-cc-pVTZ/C and aug-cc-pVQZ/C auxiliary basis sets were used for the S66 set. Consistent with the reference data,42 the interaction energies of the S66 set were corrected for the BSSE. CBS(3/4) extrapolation of the correlation energies was carried out as described previously.43 Hence, eq. 2 was used with ß = 3.05 (or, equivalently, eq. 4 with F = 1.712). 
3. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
In this section, the accuracy and efficiency of the PNO extrapolation (eq. 4 with F = 1.5) is discussed on the GMTKN55 superset. As shown in the “SUMMARY” sheet of the Supporting Information, PNO extrapolation improves the accuracy of both the CCSD and the (T) components of the correlation energy. For the sake of simplicity, only the accuracy of the extrapolated DLPNO-CCSD(T) energies is discussed in the following.
3.1. Accuracy of the PNO extrapolation. Figure 2 shows the MAEs for the computed DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK reaction energies using different TCutPNO thresholds and PNO extrapolation schemes. In particular, TCutPNO = 10-X (X = 5, 6, and 7) as well as 5/6 and 6/7 extrapolations were tested. Canonical CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK results were used as reference, as described in the Section 2.2. 
As expected, TCutPNO = 10-5 and 10-6 calculations (red and green bars in Figure 2, respectively) are extremely efficient but yield significantly large errors. Note that TCutPNO = 10-6 is the default for the so called “LoosePNO” settings, which are only recommended for preliminary DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, whilst TCutPNO = 10-5 is never recommended in standard DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations. The MAEs obtained with TCutPNO = 10-5 and 10-6 are generally between 1.5 and 3 kcal/mol, with error reaching up to 12 kcal/mol (TCutPNO = 10-5) and 6 kcal/mol (TCutPNO = 10-6) for the MBE16-43 set of artificial molecules.
Figure 2. MAEs associated with DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK reaction energies for the GMTKN55 subsets with TCutPNO = 10-X (X = 5, 6, and 7) and with the 5/6 and 6/7 extrapolations relative to the canonical CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK results.
In contrast, 5/6 extrapolation (blue bars in Figure 2) provides MAEs within chemical accuracy, i.e., less than 1 kcal/mol, for all benchmark sets. The only exception is the challenging MBE16-43 set, for which a MAE of about 3 kcal/mol was observed. These figures are similar to that obtained for the more expensive TCutPNO = 10-7 calculations (gray bars in Figure 2). As mentioned above, TCutPNO = 10-7 is the default for TightPNO calculations and it is often recommended for the study of noncovalent interactions.44 For noncovalent interactions (the last five subsets in Figure 2), 5/6 extrapolation provides results that are more accurate than those from TCutPNO = 10-7 calculations when the aug-c-pVDZ-DK basis set is used. However, in general, both approaches provide similar accuracy. Therefore, 5/6 extrapolation should be considered as a cost-effective - but still reasonably accurate - alternative to TightPNO calculations on large molecular systems.
Excluding the challenging MB16-43 subset, standard TightPNO calculations give MAEs less than 0.6 kcal/mol, whilst 5/6 extrapolated reaction energies show MAEs less than 0.8 kcal/mol. For these subsets, 6/7 extrapolation (yellow bars in Figure 2) is significantly more accurate, providing near sub-kJ/mol accuracy for all subsets (with MAEs of less than 0.27 kcal/mol). For example, on the S66 set for noncovalent interactions, 6/7 extrapolation (MAE = 0.11 kcal/mol) reduces the TightPNO error (MAE = 0.20 kcal/mol) by a factor of two. Interestingly, despite the significant increase in the computational cost when tightening TCutPNO to 10-8 and 10-9, the associated 7/8 (MAE = 0.08 kcal/mol) or 8/9 (MAE = 0.06 kcal/mol) extrapolations bring only a slight improvement to the 6/7 extrapolated results (see the S66 sheet of Supporting Information). Hence, 6/7 extrapolation already provides almost converged results with respect to the TCutPNO threshold, and the residual error is likely to be associated with the other approximations used in DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations.
Finally, it is worth mentioning that the relatively large error in the reaction energies of the MBE16-43 set does not change significantly if all the electron pairs are included in the coupled cluster treatment (TCutPairs = 0) (see the MBE16-43 sheet of Supporting Information). Hence, the main source of error in this case is the PNO truncation error, as demonstrated by the excellent performances of the extrapolation schemes. 
3.2. Basis Set Dependence and Efficiency. In this section, the basis set dependence and the efficiency of the PNO extrapolation scheme have been investigated on the W4-11, YBDE18, and S66 subsets.
For the W4-11 set (Figure 3a), reaction energies computed using 5/6 extrapolation are more accurate than those obtained using TCutPNO = 10-6 settings for all basis sets. Analogously, 6/7 extrapolation results are generally more accurate than TCutPNO = 10-7 results.  Importantly, the accuracy of the extrapolated results is largely independent by the basis set size. In fact, the MAE associated with the 5/6 and 6/7 extrapolated results is about the same for all basis sets. In contrast, the MAE obtained with TCutPNO = 10-7 oscillates by increasing the basis set size, reaching a minimum with the triple-? basis set and increasing again with the quadruple-? basis set.
 For the YBDE18 set (Figure 4a), 5/6 extrapolation provides an accuracy between that of TCutPNO = 10-6 and of TCutPNO = 10-7. 6/7 extrapolation provides results that are very close to those obtained using TCutPNO = 10-8. However, since the results obtained with TCutPNO = 10-7 and 10-8 are also very close to each other, 6/7 extrapolation reduces the MAE with respect to TCutPNO = 10-7 by only 0.01 kcal/mol.
For the S66 set (Figure 5a), 5/6 extrapolation (MAE = 0.23 kcal/mol) slightly improves TCutPNO = 10-6 results (MAE: 0.26 kcal/mol), whilst the 6/7 extrapolation (MAE = 0.03 kcal/mol) is significantly more accurate than TCutPNO = 10-7 results (MAE = 0.09 kcal/mol), providing results of essentially TCutPNO = 10-8 accuracy (MAE = 0.03 kcal/mol).
The timing associated with the various DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations for the W4-11, YBDE18, and S66 subsets is shown in Figures 3b, 4b and 5b, respectively. In average, the computational cost of 5/6 extrapolation is only 46% higher than that of TCutPNO = 10-6 calculations. Compared to TCutPNO = 10-7 calculations, 5/6 extrapolation is faster by a factor of 2.2. Analogously, the computational cost of 6/7 extrapolation is only 38% higher than that of TCutPNO = 10-7 calculations. Again, 6/7 extrapolation calculations are 2.0 times faster than TCutPNO = 10-8. In summary, X/Y extrapolation calculations are about two times more efficient than the corresponding 10-(Y+1) calculations. 
These computational experiments demonstrate that the suggested PNO extrapolation scheme is valid irrespective of the basis set size and provides a cost-effective but still very accurate alternative to tightening TCutPNO threshold.

3.3. Dispersion-Dominated Interactions. Herein, we discuss the accuracy and efficiency of the extrapolation scheme on three representative examples of dispersion-dominated interactions, i.e., the stacking interaction in the uracil dimer (reaction 26 of the S66 set, see Figure 6), the interaction of two pentane molecules (reaction 34 of the S66 set, see Figure 7), and the bowl to cage isomerization reaction of C20 (reaction 2 of the DC13 set, see Figure 8).

(b) The computational time of the correlation part of the interaction energy with the corresponding computational settings by using 16 cores from a single cluster node equipped with 4 Intel Xeon CPUs.

(b) The computational time of the correlation part of the interaction energy with the corresponding computational settings by using 16 cores from a single cluster node equipped with 4 Intel Xeon CPUs. Computational time for the extrapolations is obtained as the sum of the time required with the involving TCutPNO settings and basis sets.
Figure 8. (a) The error in the DLPNO-CCSD(T)/TightPNO/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK bowl to cage isomerization energy of C20 with TCutPNO = 10-X (X = 5, 6, 7, and 8) and with the 5/6 and 6/7 extrapolations relative to the canonical CCSD(T)/aug-cc-pVDZ-DK isomerization energy. (b) The computational time of the correlation part of the isomerization energy with the corresponding computational settings by using 4 cores from a single cluster node equipped with 4 Intel Xeon CPUs. Computational time for the extrapolations is obtained as the sum of the time required with the involving TCutPNO settings.
For these systems, 5/6 extrapolation does not generally provide a significant improvement over TCutPNO = 10-6, because the TCutPNO = 10-5 results are dominated by the perturbative contribution, which largely overestimates the strength of dispersion interactions. The default TightPNO calculations also feature relatively large errors, i.e., 0.31, 0.12 and 2.41 kcal/mol for the uracil dimer interaction, pentane dimer interaction and the C20 isomerization reaction, respectively. In contrast, 6/7 extrapolation reduces the error to 0.01, 0.01, and 1.05 kcal/mol, respectively. With ~40% smaller computational cost, 6/7 extrapolation is even slightly more accurate than TCutPNO = 10-8. As the latter becomes unaffordable already for medium-sized systems (also due to its huge memory requirements), 6/7 extrapolation provides a cost-effective alternative to tightening TCutPNO threshold, yielding essentially canonical CCSD(T) accuracy even for such challenging reactions.
4. CONCLUSIONS
We proposed a computational strategy to approach the complete PNO space limit in DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations. Results obtained using different TCutPNO values were extrapolated using a two-point extrapolation scheme, while keeping all the remaining parameters of the calculations fixed to the TighPNO default. Our scheme was validated on the most challenging subsets of the GMTKN55 superset, including a total of 883 molecules and 499 reactions. 
Typically, 5/6 extrapolation provides an accuracy between that of TCutPNO = 10-6 and TCutPNO = 10-7 calculations at a small fraction of the TCutPNO = 10-7 computational cost. It is especially recommended as a cost-effective alternative to TightPNO calculations for very large systems, for which standard TightPNO calculations are computationally too demanding. 
In all cases, 6/7 extrapolation provides results that are more accurate than those obtained from standard TightPNO calculations. Its accuracy is comparable to that obtained using TCutPNO = 10-8 but at a substantially lower computational cost. The residual error is associated to the remaining approximations made in DLPNO-CCSD(T) calculations, such as the RI and strong-pairs approximations.
